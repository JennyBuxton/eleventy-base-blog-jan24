# About Me


I am currently a secondary school teacher, teaching computer science, business and media to 11-19 year olds.

I have a degree in Information Systems BSc from the University of Leeds and I graduated in 2009.
Since then I have also gained a PGCE in secondary teaching (Computer Science) from Leeds Trinity University where I completed a SCITT placement working in three different schools in Leeds/Bradford areas.

I am looking to work in the technology sector as it has always been an interest of mine which is why I am completing the Coder's Guild Web Development course to expand my knowledge and I will be looking for some opportunites to develop me skills by helping friends/family set up websites to develop my experience too.

I have also recently become a mum to a little boy who has had a bit of a tough start in life. He has recently recovered from open heart surgery as he was born with a hole in his heart. He is now 16 months and doing very well, a ball of energy! So I am looking for a job which can give me a bit of flexibility and work/life balance.
