## Coder's Guild Web Development Course

Learning how to set up a static site and why we might use them, basically if you need a site which does not change regularly you would use a static site.

We have learnt about eleventy and netlify - we will deploy this to netlify.
Netlify is the published website.

All of this is pretty confusing at the moment but I am sure once I use it a few times then I will understand more which each software is used for exactly and how they all work together.

## Git


This is an example of how to include some code in the blog:

```diff-js
 // this is a command
 function myCommand() {
+  let counter = 0;
-  let counter = 1;
   counter++;
 }

 // Test with a line break above this line.
 console.log('Test');
```
